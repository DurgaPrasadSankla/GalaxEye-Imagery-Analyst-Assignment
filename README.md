# Cross-Sensor (EO/SAR) Impact Analysis: Delhi Yamuna Flood (July 2023)

**Prepared by: Durga Prasad Sankla**

---

### Project Overview

This repository contains the analytical report and visual outputs for a cross-sensor (EO/SAR) impact analysis of the catastrophic flooding event along the Yamuna River in Delhi during July 2023.

**A Note on This Submission:** As Per our discussion, this submission focuses on the data analysis, interpretation, documentation and final report rather than the coding implementation. The methodology and data acquisition steps are presented conceptually within the report.

### Region of Interest (ROI)

The analysis focuses on a densely populated urban section of Delhi centered on the Yamuna River, including key infrastructure and residential areas.

### Key Objectives

The primary objective is to demonstrate the critical importance of a multi-sensor approach for disaster management. This analysis shows how Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides clear, actionable intelligence during an active weather event when traditional optical (EO) sensors are completely obscured by clouds.

### Summary of Key Findings

* **Optical Failure:** Optical sensors (Sentinel-2) were completely obscured by monsoon cloud cover during the critical flood period, rendering them analytically useless.
* **SAR Success:** SAR technology (Sentinel-1) successfully penetrated the clouds and rain, providing clear, actionable intelligence on the full extent of the flood.
* **Strategic Validation:** The analysis validates a "SAR-first" approach for any operational monitoring system focused on active storm and flood events, demonstrating its irreplaceable value for immediate disaster response.

### Repository Structure

* **/reports:** Contains the final analytical report in PDF format and quick summary in TXT format.
* **/output:** Contains all generated visual outputs, including before/after images, annotated comparisons, and the final change mask.
