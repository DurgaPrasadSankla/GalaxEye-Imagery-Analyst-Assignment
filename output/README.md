### Output Visuals

This folder contains the final visual outputs from the "Delhi Yamuna Flood" analysis.

* **Figure 1:** Sentinel-2 (Optical) image from June 13, 2023. This shows the clear, pre-flood baseline with the river as a narrow channel.
  
* **Figure 2:** Sentinel-1 (SAR) image from the same day (June 13, 2023), confirming the normal, narrow river channel.
* **Figure 3:** Sentinel-2 (Optical) image from July 13, 2023. This image is analytically useless, as the view is completely blocked by monsoon clouds.
* **Figure 4:** Sentinel-1 (SAR) image from July 13, 2023. This image clearly penetrates the clouds, showing the massive, wide expanse of the floodwaters.
* **Figure 5:** A side-by-side annotated comparison of the "Before" (Figure 2) and "After" (Figure 4) SAR images, highlighting the flood's impact.
* **Figure 6:** A generated change mask (red overlay) on the SAR image, confirming the submergence of the central river island and inundation of adjacent lands.
